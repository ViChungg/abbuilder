# abbuilder
The AB Builder lets users keep track of their skincare routine. It contains a database of products that contain ratings, 
and the user can add their own ratings too.

The Diary allows users to write down notes about certain products. It helps them keep track of what products they have used, and if it
works for them or not.

This is a work in progress.
